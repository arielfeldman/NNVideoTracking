# RNEL Solutions for Video Tracking Throughout Behavioral Experiments

We provide two different open sourced programs for use in tracking rodent movement in behavioral paradigms without needing to attach any external devices (such as a light emitting diode) to track the animal's position. When analyzing rat behavior in attention sensitive experiments, it is imperative that a robust video tracking technique be used in order to isolate the rat’s head and thus more easily identify the direction, and object, of its attention. By doing so, we are able to extrapolate a more accurate representation of the rat’s interests and behavior when surrounded by both a novel and familiar object at once, as opposed to making assumptions based off of a threshold regarding the distance of the center of the rat to each object. With a center-based tracker, a wider array of situations may qualify, as being the center of the rat’s directed attention, when this may not be the case. Using the programs written, we can extract the spatial relationship between the rat’s proximity to the different objects and the neural firing pattern recorded by implanted electrodes.


# Notes on Usage

The two solutions assume different situations for use, which can be found enumerated within their respective folders. As well, one provides a more user friendly interface and more information than the other, earlier solution to the behavioral video tracking problem.
